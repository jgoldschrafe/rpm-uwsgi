= uWSGI Documentation (full list of options updated to 0.9.7.2) =

The following list contains a good part (yes, not all, please help improving the doc instead of ranting...) of the uWSGI options in no particular order (even if you will find
the most important/used on top). Every option can be set in all the supported configuration ways (command line args, environment variables,
xml, ini, yaml and LDAP). Some option requires the loading of a plugin, in such case the name of the plugin will be reported in the doc.

The examples use various style of configuration to force the user to better understand the way uWSGI works.

If you are new to uWSGI you should probably give a look at the [wiki:Quickstart] and [wiki:Example Examples] sections for real-world-usage-configurations as the following huge list can really hurt you


== Little introduction about config styles ==

When choosing a configuration style or when moving from one configuration style to another, check the following rules:

'''command line args:''' add the '''--''' prefix to the option

the socket option will be:

{{{
--socket <path/address>
}}}

'''environment variable:''' the option name is uppercased and prefixed with UWSGI_, all the dashes are substituted with underscore

max-vars option became

{{{
UWSGI_MAX_VARS="<n>"
}}}

'''xml:''' the root node should be <uwsgi> and all the option values are reported as text node. Options that work as flag can be reported without value

socket and master options became

{{{

<uwsgi>
    <socket>127.0.0.1:3031</socket>
    <master/>
</uwsgi>
}}}

'''ini:''' the config section should be ''uwsgi'', options that work as flag can be set as ''true'' or as ''1''

socket and master options became

{{{

[uwsgi]
socket = 127.0.0.1:3031
master = true

}}}

'''yaml:''' the root element should be '''uwsgi''', options that work as flag can be set as ''true'' or as ''1''

socket and master options became

{{{
uwsgi:
  socket: 127.0.0.1
  master: 1
}}}

'''ldap:''' it is a complex topic, you should check the dedicated wiki page. see [wiki:useLDAP]

= The infinite list of options... =

Here we came, take a breath and open your mind

[[BR]]

=== socket ===

Specify the path (in case of UNIX socket) or the address (for INET sockets) of the socket where the uwsgi clients (your webserver) will connect to.
You can specify up to 8 socket options. When used as a command line arg you can use the '-s' shortcut

{{{
--socket /tmp/uwsgi.sock
}}}

will bind to the unix socket /tmp/uwsgi.sock

{{{
-s 127.0.0.1:1717
}}}

will bind to ipv4 address 127.0.0.1 on port 1717

{{{
[uwsgi]
socket = 127.0.0.1:1717
socket = 127.0.0.1:2626
}}}

will bind to ipv4 address 127.0.0.1 on port 1717 and ipv4 address 127.0.0.1 on port 2626



=== processes or workers ===

Set the number of workers for preforking mode.
This is the base for easy and safe concurrency in your app. More workers you add, more concurrent requests you can manage.
Each worker correspond to a system process, so it consumes memory, choose carefully the right number. You can easily drop down your system if you set a too high value.

When used as a command line arg you can shortcut it with -p 

{{{
--processes 8
}}}

will spawn 8 workers

{{{
--workers 4
}}}

will spawn 4 workers

{{{
-p 8
}}}

will spawn 8 workers

{{{
<uwsgi>
    <workers>3</workers>
</uwsgi>
}}}

will spawn 3 workers


=== harakiri ===

This will set the harakiri timeout (look at the wiki home page for a better understanding).
Every request that will take longer than the seconds specified in the harakiri timeout will be dropped and the corresponding
worker recycled.

{{{
--harakiri 60
}}}

will kill every request that will take more than 60 seconds to complete

=== harakiri-verbose ===

When a request is killed by harakiri you will get a message in the uWSGI log. Enabling this option
will print additional info (for example in Linux will be reported the current syscall)

{{{
--harakiri-verbose
}}}

will enable the additional infos during aharakiri


=== xmlconfig or xml ===

Load the specified xml configuration file. When used as a command line arg it can be shortcutted with -x
You can have multiple <uwsgi> stanzas in your file marked with the id attribute. To choose the stanza to use, specify
its id after the filename (using a colon as a separator)

{{{
--xml /etc/myapp.xml
}}}

will load the /etc/myapp.xml config file

{{{
--xml /etc/myapp.xml:django
}}}

will use the uwsgi stanza marked as 'django' in the /etc/myapp.xml config file

This file can be something like this:

{{{
<all_the_apps>

  <uwsgi id="turbogears">
    <socket>/tmp/tg.sock</socket>
  </uwsgi>

  <uwsgi id="django">
    <socket>/tmp/django.sock>
  </uwsgi>

</all_the_apps>
}}}

in this case the root node can be whatever you want (this will allows you to add uwsgi stanzas in other xml files)

This option is implicit when the last command line argument ends with .xml

{{{
/usr/bin/uwsgi /etc/myapp.xml
}}}

will automatically load the /etc/myapp.xml config file

=== daemonize ===

Run the processes in background using a logfile or a udp server

{{{
--daemonize /var/log/uwsgi.log
}}}

will damonize uWSGI writing log messages to /var/log/uwsgi.log

{{{
[uwsgi]
daemonize = 192.168.0.100:4000
}}}

will daemonize uWSGI sending logs the the udp server listening on address 192.168.0.100 port 4000 See UdpLogging

=== listen ===

set the socket listen queue (default: 100). 

Every socket has an associated queue where request will be put waiting for a process to became ready to accept them.
When this queue is full requests will be rejected.

The maximum value is system/kernel dependent. 


=== max-vars ===

Set the max number of variables a uwsgi client (your webserver) can pass.
This is only a security mesasure, probably you will never need to touch it.

=== buffer-size ===

Set the internal buffer size for uwsgi packet parsing. Default is 4k.

If you plan to receive big requests with a lot of headers you can increase this value upto 64k

{{{
--buffer-size 32768
}}}

will allows the uWSGI server to receive uwsgi packet up to 32k, bigger packet will be rejected.

=== memory-report ===

enable memory usage report.
This will print in the request log information about RSS and address space usage.


{{{
<uwsgi>
    <memory-report/>
</uwsgi>
}}}


=== cgi-mode ===

Enable cgi mode. Responses will not be HTTP valid response, but cgi one (the Status: header will be added)

=== abstract-socket ===


=== chmod-socket or chmod ===

unix sockets are filesystem object that must obey to unix permission scheme.
You can set unix sockets permissions with this option if your webserver has no access to the uWSGI socket.

When used as a flag this option will set permissions to 666, otherwise the spcified scheme will be used

{{{
<uwsgi>
    <chmod-socket/>
</uwsgi>
}}}

will set socket permissions to 666

{{{
<uwsgi>
    <chmod-socket>644</chmod-socket>
</uwsgi>
}}}

will set socket permissions to 644


=== map-socket ===

As you can bind a uWSGI instance to multiple sockets, you can map specific workers to specific soxkets to implement in-process QoS

{{{
[uwsgi]
socket = /tmp/uwsgi0.sock
socket = /tmp/uwsgi1.sock
workers = 5
map-socket = 0:1,2,3
map-socket = 1:4,5
}}}

This will map workers 1, 2 and 3 to the first socket and 4 and 5 to the second one.

If you host multiple apps in the same uWSGI instance, you can easily dedicate resources to each of them.

=== enable-threads ===

Enable threads in the embedded languages. This will allow to spawn threads in your app.

=== single-interpreter ===

Some of the supported languages (like python) has the concept of "multiple interpreters".
They allows to isolate apps living in the same process. If you do not want this kind of feature
use this option.

=== master ===

enable the master process

=== emperor ===

Start the uWSGI [wiki:Emperor]

=== emperor-amqp-vhost ===

set virtualhost name in AMQP emperor mode

=== emperor-amqp-username ===

set username name in AMQP emperor mode

=== emperor-amqp-password ===

set password name in AMQP emperor mode

=== reload-mercy ===

set the maximum amount of seconds to wait for a worker death during a graceful reload

{{{
--reload-mercy 8
}}}

will brutally kill every worker that will not terminate itself within 8 seconds during graceful reload

=== exit-on-reload ===

force the uWSGI stack to terminate itself even if a reload is requested.
This option is useful only in exotic cases.


=== help or usage ===

print the help on the stdout then exit


=== reaper ===

Enable reaper mode. After each request the server will cal waitpid(-1) to get rid of all the zombies.
If you spawn subprocesses in your app and you ends with zombies all over the place you can enable this option.
But you should fix your process spawning usage (if you can) ...

=== max-requests ===

set the maximum number of requests for each worker.
When a worker reaches this number it will get recycled. You can use this option to dumb fight memory leaks (even if reload-on-as and reload-on-rss
are more useful for this kind of problem)

{{{
[uwsgi]
max-requests = 1000
}}}

will recycle a worker every 1000 requests

=== socket-timeout ===

set the internal timeout for all the socket operations. (default 4 seconds)

{{{
--socket-timeout 10
}}}

will close connections after 10 seconds of inactivity

=== sharedarea ===

This enables the SharedArea. This is a low level shared memory. If you want a more usable/user-friendly system look at the CachingFramework


{{{

}}}

will create a shared memory area of 10 pages

=== cache ===

Enable the shared cache. See CachingFramework

Enable the [wiki:Spooler] on the specified directory

{{{
[uwsgi]
spooler = /home/foo/spooler
}}}

will save spooler file in the /home/foo/spooler directory

=== disable-logging ===

Disable request logging. Log only errors and uWSGi internal messages

=== pidfile ===

write the pidfile to the specified file before privileges drop

=== pidfile2 ===

write the pidfile to the specified file after privileges drop

=== ini ===

=== yaml or yml ===


=== ldap ===

Load configuration fron an ldap server. See UseLdap

=== ldap-schema ===

dump the LDAP schema (old-style format)

=== ldap-schema-ldif ===

dump the LDAP schema in LDIF format (new openldap)

=== no-server ===

initialize the uWSGI server but exit as soon as the initialization is complete (useful for testing)

=== no-defer-accept ===

by default (where available) uWSGI will defer the accept() of requests until some data is sent by the client (this is a security/performance measure).
If you want to disable this feature specify this option.

=== limit-as ===

limit the address space usage of each uWSGI process using POSIX/UNIX setrlimit()

{{{
--limit-as 256
}}}

will avoid uWSGI processes to grow over 256MB of address space.
Address space is the virtual memory a process has access to. It does not correspond to physical memory.

Read and understand this page before enabling it: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory

=== reload-on-as ===

recycle a workers when its address space usage is over the limit specified

{{{
--reload-on-as 128
}}}

will reload a worker if it consumes more than 128 megs of address space

=== reload-on-rss ===

Works as reload-on-as but it control the physical unshared memory.
You can enable both

{{{
uwsgi:
  reload-on-as: 128
  reload-on-rss: 96
}}}

will recycle a workers when its address space usage is hgher than 128 megs or its rss usage is higher than 96 megs

=== touch-reload ===

gracefully reload the uWSGI stack when a file/directory changes.

{{{
uwsgi:
  touch-reload: /tmp/reload.txt
}}}

if you

{{{
touch /tmp/reload.txt
}}}

the uWSGI server will be gracefully reloaded

=== limit-post ===

limit the size of body in HTTP requests. It reads the CONTENT_LENGTH uwsgi variable to know the size

{{{
--limit-post 65536
}}}

will disallow request body higher than 64k

=== no-orphans ===

automatically kill workers without a master process

=== prio ===

set to process priority for the system scheduler

{{{
<uwsgi>
    <prio>20</prio>
</uwsgi>
}}}

will set the process priority to 20 (the value is system dependent)

=== cpu-affinity ===

Set the CPU affinity (Linux Only) See http://lists.unbit.it/pipermail/uwsgi/2011-March/001594.html

=== post-buffering ===

enable http body buffering. uWSGI will save to disk all HTTP body bigger than the limit specified.

{{{
[uwsgi]
post-buffering = 8192
}}}

will save to disk all the HTTP body bigger than 8K.
This option is required for Rack applications as they require a rewindable input stream.

=== post-buffering-bufsize ===

set the internal buffer size during post buffering (this is the memory allocated to read chunks of the socket stream)

{{{
post-buffering-bufsize 65536
}}}

will allocate 64k as the buffer for socket recv(). For a 128k body two cycle/syscall will be used.

This is a very advanced option you will probably never need to touch.

=== upload-progress ===

Enable the embedded upload progress. You pass the name of a directory where uWSGI as write permissions.
For every upload a JSON file will be written to this directory reporting the status of the upload. You can use ajax to read
these files. So configure your webserver to allow access to the directory set.

{{{
--upload-progress /var/www/progress
}}}

The user upload a file to the url 

{{{
http://uwsgi.it/upload?X-Progress-ID=550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
}}}

uWSGI find the X-Progress-ID in the query string and create a file called 

{{{
550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000.js
}}}

in /var/www/progress with this kind of content

{{{
{ "state" : "uploading", "received" : 170000, "size" : 300000 }
}}}


Supposing you have mapped /progress to /var/www/progress in your webserver, you can get those json data via
ajax pointing to 

{{{
/progress/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000.js
}}}

probably your webserver has a very similar functionality, but if you need to hack it (or simply have more control) delegate
this to the uWSGI server

=== no-default-app ===

By default, when uWSGI does not find a corresponding app for the specified SCRIPT_NAME variable, will use the default app
(most of the time the app mounted under /). Enabling this option will return an error in case of unavailable app.

=== manage-script-name ===

If for some reason your webserver cannot manage SCRIPT_NAME you can force uWSGI to rebuild the PATH_INFO automatically.

=== udp ===

start a udp server. Mainly useful for [wiki:UseSnmp snmp] or as a shared logger for UdpLogging

=== multicast ===

internal option, usable by third party plugins.

=== cluster ===

Join the specified cluster. See [wiki:Clustering]

=== cluster-nodes ===

You can get the list of nodes in a cluster without joining it

{{{
--cluster-nodes 225.1.1.1:1717
}}}

will get the list of nodes of the 225.1.1.1:1717 cluster. This list is used internally by the uwsgi load balancing api.

=== cluster-reload ===

gracefully reload a whole cluster

{{{
--cluster 225.1.1.1:1717 --cluster-reload
}}}

will reload all the nodes in the 225.1.1.1:1717 cluster

=== cluster-log ===

log a message to all the nodes of a cluster

{{{
--cluster 225.1.1.1:1717 --cluster-log "Hello World"
}}}

will print "Hello World" to all the nodes logfiles

=== subscribe-to ===

subscribe to a SubscriptionServer, you can subscribe to multiple server using this option multiple times

{{{
[uwsgi]
subscribe-to = 192.168.0.1:2626:unbit.it
subscribe-to = 192.168.0.2:2626:uwsgi.it
}}}

=== shared-socket ===

Advanced option for plugin writers or special needs. Allow to create a socket during server early startup
and use it after privileges drop or jailing.

=== snmp ===

enable the SNMP server. See UseSnmp

=== snmp-community ===

set the snmp community string

=== check-interval ===

The master process make a scan every seconds. You can increase this time if you need. DISCOURAGED.

=== binary-path ===

If you do not have uWSGI in the system path you can force its path with this option to permit the reloading system
and the [wiki:Emperor] to easily find the binary to execute.

=== async ===

Enable the async mode. See AsyncSupport

=== logto ===

Log to specific file or udp server

=== logfile-chown ===

=== log-syslog ===

Log to syslog instead of a log-file.

Passing a parameter makes uwsgi use the parameter as program-name in the syslog entry header:
{{{
--log-syslog mywebapp
}}}

=== log-master ===

delegate the write of the logs to the master process (this will put all of the logging I/O to a single process). Useful for
system with advanced I/O schedulers/elevators

=== logdate ===

report the date in every log line. You can pass an option with strftime() syntax

=== threads ===

enable threaded operational mode.
You have to specify the number of threads per worker

{{{
--threads 40 --workers 2
}}}

will spawn two workers with 40 threads (total 80 threads)


=== vhost ===

enable virtual hosting mode. See VirtualHosting

=== vhost-host ===

By default the virtualhosting mode use the SERVER_NAME variable as the hostname key.
If you want to use the HTTP_HOST one (corresponding to the Host: header) add this option

=== check-static ===

Specify a directory that uWSGI will check before passing control to a specific handler.

uWSGI will check if the requested PATH_INFO has a file correspondence in this directory and eventually will serve it

{{{
--check-static /var/www/example.com
}}}

If the client ask for foo.png and this file exists as /var/www/example.com/foo.png uWSGI will directly serves it using the choosen method (sendfile() by default)

=== static-map ===

map a resource as a static file area

{{{
[uwsgi]
static-map = /media=/var/www/django/contrib/admin/media
static-map = /images=/var/www/example.com/images
}}}

Whenever a PATH_INFO starts with one of the configured resources, uWSGI will serve the file using the choosen method (sendfile() by default)

=== file-serve-mode ===

Set the static serving mode:

x-sendfile -> will use the X-Sendfile header (apache, Cherokee, lighttpd)

x-accel-redirect -> will use the X-Accel-Redirect header (nginx)

default -> sendfile()

{{{
--file-serve-mode x-sendfile
}}}

=== check-cache ===

check if an item named as PATH_INFO is available in the [wiki:CachingFramework uWSGI cache] and eventually will serves it

=== close-on-exec ===

=== mode ===

generic option, the apps can read this value with uwsgi.mode

=== env ===
set an environment variable

{{{
[uwsgi]
env = DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=mysite.settings
}}}

this will set DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE to mysite.settings

=== vacuum ===

automatically remove unix socket and pidfiles on server exit

=== loop ===

set the LoopEngine (advanced option)

=== worker-exec ===

You can run a php fastcgi server pool in this way

{{{
/usr/bin/uwsgi --workers 4 --worker-exec /usr/bin/php53-cgi 
}}}

=== attach-daemon ===

}}}



=== plugins ===

load the specified plugins

{{{
